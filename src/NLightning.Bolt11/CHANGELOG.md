## v4.0.1

Fixed `TaggedFieldList` logic to accept zero length description on an invoice.

### Fixed

## v4.0.0

Introduced a dedicated validation service and stricter field checks to improve invoice robustness, along with API
consistency and null-safety enhancements.

### Added

- Added `InvoiceValidationService` for enhanced validation during invoice decoding;
- Improved error handling with detailed `ArgumentException` messages for missing/invalid fields.
- Added [DisallowNull] on `PaymentHash`, `RoutingInfos`, `Features`, `FallbackAddresses`, `PaymentSecret`,
  `PayeePubKey`, and `MinFinalCltvExpiry` for better nullability handling;
- Added `[MaybeNullWhen(false)]` annotation to `TaggedFieldList.TryGet<T>` method for better nullability handling;

### Modified

- Modified `TaggedFieldList.Add` method to perform validation before adding new tagged fields;
- Modified `DescriptionHashTaggedField.IsValid` to return false if the `DescriptionHash` is all ones or all zeroes;
- Modified `DescriptionTaggedField` constructor and `IsValid` method to ensure the description is under
  `MaxDescriptionBytes` when converted to a UTF8 byte array;
- Modified `PaymentHashTaggedField.IsValid` to return false if the `PaymentHash` is all ones or all zeroes;
- Modified `PaymentSecretTaggedField.IsValid` to return false if the `PaymentSecret` is all ones or all zeroes;
