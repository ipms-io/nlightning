# Support

As we venture into the development of NLightning, our mission is to create a high-performance, secure, and easy-to-use
Lightning Network implementation in C#. This project not only aims to contribute to the scalability and adoption of
Bitcoin also seeks to provide developers with a reliable toolset for building innovative applications on top of the
Lightning Network.

However, this journey is not without its challenges. Development, testing, and maintenance require significant resources
and dedicated effort. While we are passionate about pushing the boundaries of what's possible with Lightning Network
technology, we also recognize the power of community support in achieving these ambitious goals.

## Why Your Support Matters

- Accelerating the development process by allowing us to dedicate more time to the project.
- Improving documentation and tutorials, making the technology accessible to more developers.
- Expanding our testing frameworks to ensure reliability and security.

advancement. Whether you're a user looking forward to a stable release, a developer eager to contribute, or simply a
